# Insights

This course intends to be the circuit course for non-EE major, so you will have many different engineering students in the course. That is also to say, the department decided to squeeze as many contents as they could into one quarter. We will basically learn from circuit theory to op-amp, which was a rush. Therefore, you will need to do a lot of practice problem to excel this course. Homework was fair, a little bit more difficult than the problems on the books. Exams can be annoying due to time limit, so just be prepared. By the way, this course got a very generous curve. 85+ is an A and 90+ is an A+. What I did not like the most is the second half of the course, but they are the most important topics at the same time. Learning MOSFET and op-amp in three weeks is just impossible. I only grasped the very basics of them. At least by now I still don't know why op-amp work. My final suggestion for the department and the instructors is just to speed up the first half.

Somehow, this course demystified some of my misconception regarding circuits. At least now I'm determined that I will not be doing anything related to analog circuit, but I really like digital circuit. The skill itself is important. I indeed use a lot of the knowledge in my following courses, especially digital circuits design. The result was I no longer considering doing circuits stuff "cool, but difficult"; it's now more like "great, but complicated and is it worth it huh?".

Professor Gupta was nice. He was good at explaining concepts and provided a lot of solid examples. However, the lecture could be somehow disorganized and his hand-writing can sometimes be very confusing, making it hard to follow. He was also always 5-10 minutes late for the lecture. I guess it's because we were in the Bunche hall, which is at least 15 minutes walk from E4. Shout out to my TA Alexander. His discussion session was very awesome. Really great complimentary to the lecture.

This course is required for CE and CSE major. I think you can also do 10 + 110 (please don't). I remember professor Yang Zhang is also teaching it. Maybe he could be a better choice?
