# Insights

I personally am not a big fan of quantum theory. No offense, I prefer something more "solid" (well solid-state is not solid. it's pretty random). The reason why I took this course is simply because it's an enforced prerequisite of EC ENGR 121B, the semiconductor course (but Sam is willing to give out PTEs). I have to say that I did not have a great time in this course, but I did not suffer from it either.

The course load was ok. You will have weekly homework that's directly sourced from the textbook. Just find the equation you need and plug in the numbers then you should be fine. Both exams were fair, except the final was a little bit difficult. To be honest, this is also how I will describe this course: plug and chug. I feel like I still did not fully understand all the physics behind the semiconductor, but guess what, I know how to solve all the problems. Part of this can be attributed to my lack of interests to the subject, the other should go to the professor.

I still think that professor Wong is nice. He cared about his students, always willing to answer our dummy questions. Plus, he was very enthusiastic about his work. He tried to persuade us that the semiconductor manufacturing is an amazing industry, which I totally agree. He wrote a lot during the lecture, a lot. He can splat the whiteboard with definitions and examples, which was surprising at first. But later in the quarter, I found that every single word he wrote on the board is exactly the same as the textbook. Some students were aware of this early in the quarter and decided not to go to the lecture, but I don't think it was a bad thing. Professor Wong added his own insights and comments on some of them. This can also guarantee that the contents are valid and correct, can't it? Nevertheless, I did not learn well.

Do I recommend taking this course? No, unless it is required or you are super interested in semiconductor and solid-state physics. For most engineers, EC ENGR 121B should be more than enough, which is at the device level. If you decide to go one level deeper like wave and photonics, this course is somehow important I guess.
