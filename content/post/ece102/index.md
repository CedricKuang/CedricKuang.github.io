# Insights

You cannot get away with math as an engineer, can you? Well, math is super important in ECE. At least I've been using calculus, linear algebra and probability theory everywhere. This course is so fundamental and essential that you have to take it if you try to be an engineer. You can literally see how every concept is boiled down to abstract signals and systems and how you could apply some techniques to analyze them. This course thus made a huge impact of my career interests and learning goal. For a very long time, I've been considering signal processing and systems as my first choice (they are still on my list), until I understand that this topic itself is pretty mature and nothing novel worths doing research.

Alright, I have to warn you that this course is difficult, very difficult, at least relatively if you take it early. You will be solving integrals and convolution with complex numbers a lot. Even though we only focused on the continuous time domain, it was still difficult on squeezing all the contents in 10 weeks. Thus, things like laplace transform or other transform will be a rush (you could learn them in other courses so not a big deal). I feel like every lecture there will be a new concept, so it is very important to keep up the with the pace by doing a lot of practice problems and reviews. By the way, the textbook is really good, even though it's old, but it provides all the details you need. Homework was very difficult. It was so difficult that I literally need to go to every office hour that I was able to make it. But solving those problems was very rewarding. I would strongly recommend doing it yourself before you turn to your study group for help.

I really like professor Kadambi. He is very humorous and knowledgeable. Great at explaining those complex concepts and providing his own insights. One thing that other people don't like is that he sometimes can go too much into the tangents so that he even forgot to teach the real parts. I found this to be OK because the stories he told were at least somehow relevant to the topic and as long as we could finish everything on time (not always the case), it was fine to have some brain teaser. That being said, it takes time to get used to his teaching style, but you will benefit from it a lot if your learning pace match his frequency. He was also super nice during office hour, and most of that time was dedicated to solving homework problem. The only suggestion I have is to redesign the pace and contents of this course so we don't need to rush.

Do I recommend taking this course with professor Kadambi? Yes, of course. You will learn a lot. So Kadambi or Kao for 102? They are both good, take a look of my feedbacks on professor Kao and choose the one that matches your learning habits most.
