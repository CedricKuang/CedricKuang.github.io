# Insights

Do I like physics? If I got this question in high school or middle school, I would definitely say yes. I really enjoyed the process of setting up the context and solving the problem. However, things changed since I got into college. Physics in college is no longer that appealing (still interesting though). It's now more abstract as we name those practical stuff as "engineering". Anyway, as an engineer, I feel like I have to take some physics course. This is one of them.

So back to this course. This is part of the reason why I like the second half of the course. We use smith chart to analyze transmission line, which is very cool. It was like memorizing an algorithm and it was my first time since high school using a compass. It's a good skills to have if in the future I will be dealing with wireless communication network. However, the first half of the course was kind of boring. It was more like a complex version of physics 1C, but it indeed gave me some other intuitions of Maxwell equations. Yes, we'll need a lot of calculus so just be prepared. The workload was fine, both homework and exam make sense. Sam was still doing exams over zoom, so definitely that's a plus, isn't it?

Sam is a really nice person. He is extremely good at breaking down a complicated concept into several fundamental pieces and helping us tackle them one by one. I can imagine how boring this topic could be if it was other instructors, but Sam indeed tried his best to make this course as interesting as possible. He also did not try to fully load this course with new contents, although I thought that it could be better if he can introduce some modern research topics regarding electromagnetics like ferrobots I suppose.

Well, I was not required to take this course. Why did I still choose to take it? Solely because I had a great time with Sam in ECE 121B. If you are a CE major who does not want to work with communication and waves in physical layer, I think you will be better off by taking other courses like ECE 132A.
