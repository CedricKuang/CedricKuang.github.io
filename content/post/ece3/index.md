# Insights

**This course was taken during Covid19**

I have a mixed feeling for this course. On the one hand, I like the intuition of why this course exists. It allows all the ECE freshmen to have a taste on different aspects of ECE, so that we could better decide which direction we would like to pursue in the future. On the other hand, it emphasizes too much on circuits: at least half of the course was dedicated to circuit theory, which is not that necessary considering we have ECE 10 and 100. That being said, I did not have a chance to explore other topics since I paid all my attention on solving circuit problems.

I took this course over zoom. The lecture was OK. Professor Briggs is an interesting person and cared about his students. He liked to challenge you on some contents and made jokes on you if you don't know them, but he will always explain every detail in patience. I remembered once I submitted the wrong homework and I emailed him after the deadline, he agreed to accept it even it was super late. However, from a retrospective perspective, I did not learn a lot from the lecture, because I learned or will learn most of the contents in Physics 1B or ECE 100. Getting up at 2 am for doing quiz was not a good experience. That really made me stress out. I heard that now ECE 3 is always 8 am, so be prepared to attend the mandatory in-class quiz.

Most of my complaints came from the lab. First of all, I need to pay 300 dollar shipping fee for getting all the experiment equipments, but I guess the department and UCLA library were to blame for this. Labs in first few weeks were ok but tedious. The topics were just exploring different circuit theories using AD2 and breadboard. Again, what blocked me was not the content, it was solely because doing lab work at 2 am was not ideal. Things will get easier when the final project kicked off later in the quarter. It was designing a line-following car using Arduino. This is an interesting project and I would recommend doing it seriously as it explore several techniques in embedded system programming like sensor fusion. However, it seemed that I did not get enough support from the TA and professor. They would assume that you know some fundamental knowledge in Arduino.

In general, it's a good course with lot of different work, but definitely worth it. I think it is a required course for all ECE major, so I would recommend taking it early to see if ECE really fits your career goal and interests.
