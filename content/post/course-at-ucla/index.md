summary: All courses that I have taken at UCLA

## Brief

This page contains my reflections on all the courses that I've taken at UCLA. I sort them in the order of department and the course number. I try to provide as many objective description plus my own thoughts and opinions on these courses as possible. These are just for references, as some of them were too long ago and were taken during Covid so my experiences may not be applicable now.

## Side Notes

I guess I will open another note to talk about this specifically. If you are a potential student considering committing to UCLA, I would definitely suggest go for it. These four years was very valuable and I met tons of interesting people here. My evaluations to these courses may give you some hints about my general attitude.
